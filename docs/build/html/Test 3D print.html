<h2>Introduction<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>3D printing or additive manufacturing is a process in which solid objects are made from a digital file. The
most widely used technique is Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) in which material is layered to create
polymer-based parts, ranging from basic to complex geometrical shapes. These can be standalone parts
and/or components of a bigger structure. The relative speed of creating these parts (a couple of hours
depending on size, design, and infill) allows for proof of concepts to be developed rapidly, moving past 3D
modeling, a very powerful tool tied to 3D printing. The end results used to be used exclusively for
prototyping, however, due to the advancements of 3D printing technology and materials, 3D prints are
being used more frequently as end products and parts.</p>

<h2>Materials<a class="headerlink" href="#materials" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The most common materials for 3D printing are <strong>Poly Lactic Acid (PLA)</strong> and <strong>Acrylonitrile Butadiene
Styrene (ABS)</strong>. PLA filament is a biodegradable material that is easy to print due to its low heating
requirements, however it does not possess a very high resilience to UV rays, its more suitable for parts
used indoors and at around room temperature. ABS filament in the other hand requires a higher
temperature to be printed, but it offers UV resilience as well as better mechanical properties in high
temperature environments. There are many other materials available to print as well, depending on the
printer you use. Some materials are:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Polyethylene Terephthalate Glycol (PETG)</p></li>
<li><p>Thermoplastic Polyurethane (TPU)</p></li>
<li><p>High Impact Polystyrene (HIPS)</p></li>
<li><p>Polycarbonate (PC)</p></li>
<li><p>Thermoplastic Elastomer (TPE)</p></li>
<li><p>Nylon</p></li>
<li><p>Acrylonitrile Styrene Acrylate (ASA)</p></li>
<li><p>Polypropylene (PP)</p></li>
<li><p>Polyvinyl Alcohol (PVA)</p></li>
<li><p>Glass Fiber or Carbon Fiber Infused</p></li>
<li><p>Metal or Wood Fill</p></li>

<div class="section" id="modelling">
<h2>Modelling<a class="headerlink" href="#modelling" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>One of the advantages of 3D printing is that very complex models can be achieved. However, when
crafting your 3D model in a computer-aided design (CAD) software, such as SolidWorks, some design
considerations can help ensure better results.</p>
<p><strong>Resoultion:</strong> Similar to image resolution, a 3D printer has a minimum feature analogous to a pixel in
picture, this is the smallest “dot” it can print, and it is dependent on the nozzle size.
Resolution is divided into XY-resolution, dependent on the nozzle diameter and the smallest movement the
stepper motor on the printer can achieve and the Z-resolution is dependent on the layer height.
Each printer can have a different minimum layer height.</p>

<a class="reference external image-reference" href="../_static/images/3DPDG4.PNG"><img alt="_images/3DPDG4.PNG" src="_images/3DPDG4.PNG" /></a>
</div>
<p><strong>Orientation:</strong> Printing orientation of the 3D model can greatly
improve the surface quality of the print. The figure displays the same
3D model printed horizontally and vertically. The horizontally print
would display a “staircase” pattern, while the on vertically print this
patter would be greatly reduced achieving a smoother print.
Conversely, when printing parts that would undergo a mechanical
load, the former would support more force applied to it at the peak of
the semi-dome than the latter.</p>
<div class="figure align-default" style="width: 600px">
<a class="reference external image-reference" href="../_static/images/3DPDG5.PNG"><img alt="_images/3DPDG5.PNG" src="_images/3DPDG5.PNG" /></a>
</div>
<p><strong>Size:</strong> If you are making a display model, then this is less critical as you can scale your
design before printing to be within the boundaries of the printing volume. This is determined
by the building platform’s area and the height of the printing chamber. Each printer has its
own unique printing volume.</p>
<p><strong>Wall Thickness:</strong> A minimum wall thickness is required for the
model to be able to print and be structurally sound. This dimension
would be affected if the model needs to support any force, but as a
rule of thumb for ABS it is recommended to use a minimum wall
thickness of 1.2mm. Different materials and printers have their own configurations.</p>
<p><strong>Shrinkage and Assembly:</strong> When printing parts that are design to
be connected to each other, keep in mind the shrinkage that the
prints will undergo. This deviation of the print from the model’s
nominal size is also known as <strong>dimensional accuracy</strong> and is
generally around 0.1% or ±0.2mm.</p>
<div class="figure align-default" style="width: 800px">
<a class="reference external image-reference" href="../_static/images/3DPDG6.PNG"><img alt="_images/3DPDG6.PNG" src="_images/3DPDG6.PNG" /></a>
</div>
<p><strong>Embossed and Engraved Details:</strong> Engraving refers to details added into the print (inwards),
a minimum line thickness of 1 mm and a depth of 0.3 mm is recommended. By contrast, embossing
are details that protrude from the printed model, a line thickness of at minimum 2.5 mm and a
depth of at least 0.5 mm is advice. Engravings are usually preferred as they require much lower
tolerances than embossing details.</p>

<a class="reference external image-reference" href="../_static/images/3DPDG7.PNG"><img alt="_images/3DPDG7.PNG" src="_images/3DPDG7.PNG" /></a>
</div>
<p><strong>Support Material:</strong> To be able to achieve intricate designs most 3D printers employ support
material. The most popular ones being soluble and breakaway ones. Both types of supports have their
cons and pros, soluble support materials are easy to remove, since it dissolves on a solution,
leaving behind a clean print, however some soluble support material such as PVA take up to 24hrs
to fully dissolve. By contrast, breakaway support materials can be removed from the print as soon
as the model is completed, but in certain complex geometries they tend to leave residue behind
and/or are difficult to completely remove without damaging the print if the design possess
deep channels or crevices in the inside faces of the model, especially if no exit hole is
built into the design. This is very important to keep in mind when modeling your 3D design.</p>

</div>
<p><strong>Moving Parts:</strong> Support material allows for the printing of preassembled models
with moving parts, for these to successfully print a minimum clearance of 0.4mm
is advised, the greater the space that can be afford, the better chance the model has to print properly.</p>

<h2>STL Format<a class="headerlink" href="#stl-format" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>After you have finished your design, save the SolidWorks model in the native format SolidWorks Part File
(SLDPRT) as well as the Standard Triangle/Tessellation Language file format (STL) [1]. To save your
model in STL format go to File&gt;&gt;Save as, and change the file format from SolidWorks Part (<em>.prt;</em>.sldprt)
to STL (<a href="#id1"><span class="problematic" id="id2">*</span></a>.stl) in the prompted window, as shown in the image below:</p>

</div>
<p>The SLDPRT file stores the part as a solid model, keeping the specified details of material, color, and
texture. On the other hand, an STL file stores only the information of the 3D model surface, it represents
this surface as small adjacent triangles.</p>

<p>The .STL file will be imported into a slicer, a software that produces a path for the 3D printer to
follow to be able to print the model. This set of commands or language is known as G-code, and it
tells the printer what movements to make from begging to end of the print.</p>
