<p>Welcome to Memorial University’s Student Design Hub! Here you have access to multiple 3D printers where can
bring your digital designs to life!</p>

<div class="section" id="introduction">
<h2>Introduction<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>3D printing or additive manufacturing is a process in which solid objects are made from a digital file. The
most widely used technique is Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) in which material is layered to create
polymer-based parts, ranging from basic to complex geometrical shapes. These can be standalone parts
and/or components of a bigger structure. The relative speed of creating these parts (a couple of hours
depending on size, design, and infill) allows for proof of concepts to be developed rapidly, moving past 3D
modeling, a very powerful tool tied to 3D printing. The end results used to be used exclusively for
prototyping, however, due to the advancements of 3D printing technology and materials, 3D prints are
being used more frequently as end products and parts.</p>

<div class="section" id="materials">
<h3>Materials<a class="headerlink" href="#materials" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The most common materials for 3D printing are <strong>Poly Lactic Acid (PLA)</strong> and <strong>Acrylonitrile Butadiene
Styrene (ABS)</strong>. PLA filament is a biodegradable material that is easy to print due to its low heating
requirements, however it does not possess a very high resilience to UV rays, its more suitable for parts
used indoors and at around room temperature. ABS filament in the other hand requires a higher
temperature to be printed, but it offers UV resilience as well as better mechanical properties in high
temperature environments. There are many other materials available to print as well, depending on the
printer you use. Some materials are:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Polyethylene Terephthalate Glycol (PETG)</p></li>
<li><p>Thermoplastic Polyurethane (TPU)</p></li>
<li><p>High Impact Polystyrene (HIPS)</p></li>
<li><p>Polycarbonate (PC)</p></li>
<li><p>Thermoplastic Elastomer (TPE)</p></li>
<li><p>Nylon</p></li>
<li><p>Acrylonitrile Styrene Acrylate (ASA)</p></li>
<li><p>Polypropylene (PP)</p></li>
<li><p>Polyvinyl Alcohol (PVA)</p></li>
<li><p>Glass Fiber or Carbon Fiber Infused</p></li>
<li><p>Metal or Wood Fill</p></li>

<div class="section" id="modelling">
<h3>Modelling<a class="headerlink" href="#modelling" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>One of the advantages of 3D printing is that very complex models can be achieved. However, when
crafting your 3D model in a computer-aided design (CAD) software, such as SolidWorks, some design
considerations can help ensure better results.</p>
<p><strong>Resoultion:</strong> Similar to image resolution, a 3D printer has a minimum feature analogous to a pixel in
picture, this is the smallest “dot” it can print, and it is dependent on the nozzle size.
Resolution is divided into XY-resolution, dependent on the nozzle diameter and the smallest movement the
stepper motor on the printer can achieve and the Z-resolution is dependent on the layer height.
Each printer can have a different minimum layer height.</p>
<div class="figure align-default" style="width: 600px">
<a class="reference external image-reference" href="../_static/images/3DPDG3.PNG"><img alt="_images/3DPDG3.PNG" src="_images/3DPDG3.PNG" /></a>
</div>
<div class="figure align-default" style="width: 600px">
<a class="reference external image-reference" href="../_static/images/3DPDG4.PNG"><img alt="_images/3DPDG4.PNG" src="_images/3DPDG4.PNG" /></a>
</div>
<p><strong>Orientation:</strong> Printing orientation of the 3D model can greatly
improve the surface quality of the print. The figure displays the same
3D model printed horizontally and vertically. The horizontally print
would display a “staircase” pattern, while the on vertically print this
patter would be greatly reduced achieving a smoother print.
Conversely, when printing parts that would undergo a mechanical
load, the former would support more force applied to it at the peak of
the semi-dome than the latter.</p>
<div class="figure align-default" style="width: 600px">
<a class="reference external image-reference" href="../_static/images/3DPDG5.PNG"><img alt="_images/3DPDG5.PNG" src="_images/3DPDG5.PNG" /></a>
</div>
<p><strong>Size:</strong> If you are making a display model, then this is less critical as you can scale your
design before printing to be within the boundaries of the printing volume. This is determined
by the building platform’s area and the height of the printing chamber. Each printer has its
own unique printing volume.</p>
<p><strong>Wall Thickness:</strong> A minimum wall thickness is required for the
model to be able to print and be structurally sound. This dimension
would be affected if the model needs to support any force, but as a
rule of thumb for ABS it is recommended to use a minimum wall
thickness of 1.2mm. Different materials and printers have their own configurations.</p>
<p><strong>Shrinkage and Assembly:</strong> When printing parts that are design to
be connected to each other, keep in mind the shrinkage that the
prints will undergo. This deviation of the print from the model’s
nominal size is also known as <strong>dimensional accuracy</strong> and is
generally around 0.1% or ±0.2mm.</p>
<div class="figure align-default" style="width: 800px">
<a class="reference external image-reference" href="../_static/images/3DPDG6.PNG"><img alt="_images/3DPDG6.PNG" src="_images/3DPDG6.PNG" /></a>
</div>
<p><strong>Embossed and Engraved Details:</strong> Engraving refers to details added into the print (inwards),
a minimum line thickness of 1 mm and a depth of 0.3 mm is recommended. By contrast, embossing
are details that protrude from the printed model, a line thickness of at minimum 2.5 mm and a
depth of at least 0.5 mm is advice. Engravings are usually preferred as they require much lower
tolerances than embossing details.</p>
<div class="figure align-default" style="width: 800px">
<a class="reference external image-reference" href="../_static/images/3DPDG7.PNG"><img alt="_images/3DPDG7.PNG" src="_images/3DPDG7.PNG" /></a>
</div>
<p><strong>Support Material:</strong> To be able to achieve intricate designs most 3D printers employ support
material. The most popular ones being soluble and breakaway ones. Both types of supports have their
cons and pros, soluble support materials are easy to remove, since it dissolves on a solution,
leaving behind a clean print, however some soluble support material such as PVA take up to 24hrs
to fully dissolve. By contrast, breakaway support materials can be removed from the print as soon
as the model is completed, but in certain complex geometries they tend to leave residue behind
and/or are difficult to completely remove without damaging the print if the design possess
deep channels or crevices in the inside faces of the model, especially if no exit hole is
built into the design. This is very important to keep in mind when modeling your 3D design.</p>

</div>
<p><strong>Moving Parts:</strong> Support material allows for the printing of preassembled models
with moving parts, for these to successfully print a minimum clearance of 0.4mm
is advised, the greater the space that can be afford, the better chance the model has to print properly.</p>

<h3>STL Format<a class="headerlink" href="#stl-format" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>After you have finished your design, save the SolidWorks model in the native format SolidWorks Part File
(SLDPRT) as well as the Standard Triangle/Tessellation Language file format (STL) [1]. To save your
model in STL format go to File&gt;&gt;Save as, and change the file format from SolidWorks Part (<em>.prt;</em>.sldprt)
to STL (<a href="#id1"><span class="problematic" id="id2">*</span></a>.stl) in the prompted window, as shown in the image below:</p>
<div class="figure align-default" style="width: 600px">
<a class="reference external image-reference" href="../_static/images/3DPDG11.PNG"><img alt="_images/3DPDG11.PNG" src="_images/3DPDG11.PNG" /></a>
</div>
<p>The SLDPRT file stores the part as a solid model, keeping the specified details of material, color, and
texture. On the other hand, an STL file stores only the information of the 3D model surface, it represents
this surface as small adjacent triangles.</p>

<p>The .STL file will be imported into a slicer, a software that produces a path for the 3D printer to
follow to be able to print the model. This set of commands or language is known as G-code, and it
tells the printer what movements to make from begging to end of the print.</p>

<h3>How to Use the Eryone ER-20 Printer<a class="headerlink" href="#how-to-use-the-eryone-er-20-printer" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>There are a few steps involved before printing with the Eryone ER-20 printer. The first is to
make sure your 3D model has been saved in STL format. Please review <a class="reference internal" href="#stl-format"><span class="std std-ref">STL Format</span></a> to learn how.</p>
<p>The next step is selecting a material to use in this print. The Eryone ER-20 supports 3 different materials:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Poly Latic Acid (PLA):</strong> PLA filament is a biodegradable material that is easy to print due to its low heating requirements,
however it does not possess a very high resilience to UV rays, its more suitable for parts used indoors and at around
room temperature.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Polyethylene Terephthalate Glycol (PETG):</strong> PETG is a more durable filament then PLA. It has good chemical resistance,
flexibility, and impact resistance. As well as being good for clear prints, however this also means “post processing” such
as sanding or removing supports can be much more difficult.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Thermoplastic Polyurethane (TPU):</strong> TPU is a rubber like filament offering it flexibility and versatility, however it
can be more of a challenge to print.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>More information on each filament can be found <a class="reference external" href="https://3dinsider.com/pros-and-cons-3d-printing-filaments/">here</a></p>
<p>Once you have chosen a material, the next step is to upload your STL to a Slicer. In this case we will be using Simplify3D.</p>
<p>There are two guides to using Simplify3D: A quick guide for very easy and simple PLA parts such as a chess piece and a detailed
guide for more complex parts and different materials.</p>
<p>Open up Simplify3D by double clicking the icon.</p>
<div class="figure align-default" style="width: 400px">

<a class="reference external image-reference" href="../_static/images/Eryone3.PNG"><img alt="_images/Eryone3.PNG" src="_images/Eryone3.PNG" /></a>
</div>
<p>If there is already an item(s) on the screen, please select the “Remove” button. Then click “Import”, this should bring you
to file explorer where you will open up your STL.</p>
<div class="figure align-default" style="width: 700px">
<a class="reference external image-reference" href="../_static/images/Eryone4.GIF"><img alt="_images/Eryone4.GIF" src="_images/Eryone4.GIF" /></a>
</div>
<p>Here is where you can view your model from different angles. By left clicking and dragging you can rotate around the model, by
right clicking and dragging you can change the point of rotation. The command bar on the right side of your screen is
also available for quick changes to different viewing planes, similar to <em>SOLIDWORKS</em>.</p>
<div class="figure align-default" style="width: 500px">
<a class="reference external image-reference" href="../_static/images/Eryone5.PNG"><img alt="_images/Eryone5.PNG" src="_images/Eryone5.PNG" /></a>
</div>
<p>This command bar also lets the user position, scale or rotate their model. You can also double click your model for
precise numerical changes and the ability to reset any changes.</p>
<div class="figure align-default" style="width: 700px">
<a class="reference external image-reference" href="../_static/images/Eryone6.GIF"><img alt="_images/Eryone6.GIF" src="_images/Eryone6.GIF" /></a>
</div>
<p>The center and arrange button will automatically fix the orientation of your part(s) and make them fit on the bed.</p>
<p>When arranging your part on the bed there is a few things to take into consideration. FDM printing is done by
layering melted thermoplastic on top of itself, building from the ground up. You can not print something in thin
air, there needs to be something to support it. Take a look at this bracket:</p>
<div class="figure align-default" style="width: 700px">
<a class="reference external image-reference" href="../_static/images/Eryone7.PNG"><img alt="_images/Eryone7.PNG" src="_images/Eryone7.PNG" /></a>
</div>
<p>The first arrangement does not work because it requires plastic to be laid down in thin air. The second arrangement will
print however, you should also look at the largest <strong>FLAT</strong> surface of your model and print from there. This will
assure good bed adhesion and a better chance at a successful print. The third option with a large <strong>FLAT</strong> surface to
print from and no overhang is the best option for this model.</p>
<p>Once your part(s) are arranged on the bed, click “Edit Process Settings”. This window should appear:</p>
<div class="figure align-default" style="width: 700px">
<a class="reference external image-reference" href="../_static/images/Eryone8.PNG"><img alt="_images/Eryone8.PNG" src="_images/Eryone8.PNG" /></a>
</div>
<p>This is the command center of Simplify3D, everything happens in here. In this quick guide we will not be going through all
the settings but instead checking a few things to make sure everything is right before you print. If your model consists of
any of the following features, then you may want to consider the “Advanced Guide”:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Non-PLA Material</p></li>
<li><p>Large Overhang (Support structures needed)</p></li>
<li><p>Thin Walls</p></li>
<li><p>Fine Details</p></li>
<li><p>No Large Flat Surface to Start Print From</p></li>
<li><p>Needs to be Especially Dense or Strong</p></li>
<li><p>Multiple Colours or Materials</p></li>
</ul>
<p>See here an example sheet.

<p><em>Subject to change</em></p>
<p>If your part is simple and does not fall under any of the above categories, then please follow the instructions below.</p>
<p>Once you select edit process settings this page should appear. Make sure everything is in the green boxes matches your
screen. “Coast at End” and “Wipe Nozzle” should not be checked.</p>

<p>Select the “OK” button, the window should close. Now click “Prepare to Print!”. You should be brought to this screen where
you can how the model will be printed layer by layer.</p>

<p>You can also view the different features that that the print has.</p>
<p>For a simple print there is nothing needed to do here. In the top left corner Simplify3D estimates the build time
however, it is rarely accurate. A good practice is to add about 20% more time, but it may be more or less.</p>
<p>You now want to acquire the Micro SD card and plug it into the computer using the USB A adapter. Now click “Save
Toolpaths to Disk” and transfer the SD card to the printer (Via Left side hole).</p>
<p>Make sure the printer is turned on. There is a power switch in the back. As well make sure PLA filament is inserted into
the hot end with sufficient filament still left on the spool. To learn how to insert filament click “here”.</p>
<p>When the printer is on, this should be the home page. Click the wheel and scroll to the bottom where it says, “Print
from media”. Select the file you saved to the SD card and select print.</p>

<p>If everything is okay, your model should print. It is a good idea to check on your print periodically to make sure nothing is
going wrong. If you need to stop the print for whatever reason, click the button and scroll to “Stop Print”. A Successful print
looks like this.</p>

<h3>Changing and Inserting Material<a class="headerlink" href="#changing-and-inserting-material" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Changing the material with the Eryone printer is a very simple process. The first thing you want to do is find your selected
material and bring it to the printer.</p>
<p>Now, you want to grab the wire cutters and the end of the filament, being very careful not to let go of the filament so it does
not flick back to the spool and get tangled up. Cut the end of the filament at a 45° angle and keep hold of the end or place
it back in the side spool hole.</p>

<h3>Large Overhang/ Support Material<a class="headerlink" href="#large-overhang-support-material" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Supports are needed for 3D models that have large overhangs and unsupported areas. When 3D printing with the Eryone ER-20, it is
best to avoid supports whenever possible. Printers with only 1 extruder are limited to just break-away supports which can lead to
poor finishes and more post processing. Supports also increase printing time. Sometimes you can reorient your part or even edit
the design to make it more 3D printing friendly.</p>
<div class="figure align-default" style="width: 400px">
<a class="reference external image-reference" href="../_static/images/Eryone38.PNG"><img alt="_images/Eryone38.PNG" src="_images/Eryone38.PNG" /></a>
</div>
<p>Take this H as an example. If the H were to be printed vertical, supports would be needed to print the middle section. By rotating
the part on to its back, supports are no longer needed and there is also a larger flat surface to print from which is
good for bed adhesion.</p>
<p>That being said, sometimes avoiding supports is not an option and they must be used. Look at these pictures of a bracket. No matter
what way it is oriented, supports will be needed for a successful print.</p>
<div class="figure align-default" style="width: 700px">
<a class="reference external image-reference" href="../_static/images/Eryone39.PNG"><img alt="_images/Eryone39.PNG" src="_images/Eryone39.PNG" /></a>
</div>
<p>Fortunately, Simplify3D has an automatic support structure system. With a few clicks you can generate automatic supports and even
customize them to fit your part’s structural needs.</p>
<p>Arranging your part with supports follows the same rules as normal. Try and find the largest flat surface of your part to print
from. You also want to orient your part so that little support is needed. The best option for the bracket would be the second
orientation, a large flat surface to print from and little support.</p>

<p>Simplify3D generally has pretty good support generation, however some adjustments may need to be made depending on your
part. In our bracket example there are several holes. Vertical circular holes are usually not an issue for 3D printers, with
each layer being so small, the printer can just slowly close the gap without supports. However, as you can see above, a support
has been made for one of the holes.  This is where customizing your supports can come into play.</p>
<p>Go back to the Customize Support tab and click “Remove existing supports”. Now click the individual red pillars that you
would like to remove, in our case it is just the support in one of the holes.</p>

<p>When adding or removing support structures it is important to keep in mind one thing; are the supports necessary? You do no want
to have excess supports, this will lead to a poorer finish and more post processing. So, when adding supports be careful, Simplify3D’s
automatic supports should usually be enough. When removing, be careful as well and only remove unnecessary structures
like the supports in this bracket’s vertical holes.</p>
<p>Once you are happy with your supports, select “Done” and go to “Edit Process Settings”, then go to the “Support” tab. There
are 5 boxes we need to go over.</p>
<p><strong>Support Material Generation</strong></p>
<p>If you want to include your supports make sure the “Generate Support Material” box is checked. The “Support Extruder” should always
be “Extruder 1” because the Eryone ER-20 only has a single extruder. “Support Infill Percentage” should be at 30% and is generally
a good number unless you are dealing with fine details or small spaces that require support. You can increase this percentage
but remember the more you increase the percentage the longer your print will take. Next is “Extra Inflation Distance”, this
will make the supports “wider” depending on how big you set the number. It should be set to 0 however, may be useful if your
support-needed area is really small and you need some extra space to build your part off of. “Support Base Layers” are a tool
used to help create a better adhesion to the bed surface. If you are finding that your supports are coming loose from the bed,
this tool will make the first X number of layers denser without making the entire support that dense to save
time. <em>“Combining Support Layers” to be edited.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dense Support</strong></p>
<p>Extruder 1 should always be selected. “Dense Support Layers” will add X number of layers in between the top of the support
structure and the bottom of the actual print. This could be a useful tool if you want a larger surface area for the actual print
to begin while saving time by not having the entire structure that dense. “Dense Infill Percentage” will determine how dense
those top layers will be.</p>
<p><strong>Automatic Placement</strong></p>
<p>This box only affects the automatic support generation feature and since we have already manually adjusted our supports usually
do not need to touch anything here. However, it can be useful.</p>
<p>“Support Type” can be Normal or From Build Platform Only. Build platform will insure that supports only start from the bed
surface and will not be added into things like our bracket’s vertical holes. This can be a quick tool to get rid of any
unnecessary supports however since we already manually deleted the hole’s support, it does not need to be changed. As well
sometimes you may need supports that start from a piec of your part.</p>
<div class="figure align-default" style="width: 450px">
<a class="reference external image-reference" href="../_static/images/Eryone47.PNG"><img alt="_images/Eryone47.PNG" src="_images/Eryone47.PNG" /></a>
</div>
<p><em>This would not be the recommended orientation for this part but just used as an example.</em></p>
<p>“Support Pillar Resolution” is how large the red pillars are. This can be increased to save time adding supports to large areas
or decreased to add supports in smaller places.  “Max Overhang Angle” should be set at 45°. Changing this will determine where
automatic support structures will be placed based on the angle of the print. 45° is the general rule of thumb for support
structures but can be altered if you are having trouble with a smaller angle or do not need supports until a certain angle.</p>
<p>To reapply these settings to your automatic support generation feature. Go back to the customize support window, select
“Clear All Supports” and then “Generate Automatic Supports”.</p>
<p><strong>Separation From Part</strong></p>
<p>“Horizontal Offset From Part” should be set at 0.30 mm. This is used to create some distance between the support and a
vertical wall of your part. You may want to increase this if you find the support structures are interfering with vertical
walls. 0.30 mm is usually fine. Upper and Lower Vertical Separation layers should be set at 1 and will create a distance between
the support structure and your part. This makes the support structure easier to remove. If you are having trouble removing
supports you can increase this number but be careful, increasing this too much may render the supports useless.</p>
<p><strong>Support Infill Angles</strong></p>
<p>This box will usually just say 0. Adding an angle of 30° (for example) will make the support structure switch back and
forth between a straight line and a line at 30° for each layer. This tool can be used to create the look of a denser support
structure, however, is not commonly used.</p>

</div>
<p>To view any of your changes to these settings you can exit the process settings and select “Prepare to print”. This will
show how your support structures will be printed and you can judge your changes from this section.</p>
