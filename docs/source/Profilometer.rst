Profilometer
============
The Student Design Hub lab has a device called a "profilometer". It develops a 3D image by running a laser across an object and recording the height of the laser beam at each increment. The profilometer uses a Trispector 1060 sensor to record data and an Arduino Uno to control the motor on the apparatus. These are both connected to a router, allowing any computer that is connected to that router to communicate with the sensor and the Arduino wirelessly. A program was created to make it easier for a computer to control the motor on the apparatus without having to be plugged into the Arduino. The steps for downloading and using this program are detailed below. The software required to communicate with the sensor is called SOPAS Engineering Tool, which can be installed from `here. <https://www.sick.com/ca/en/sopas-engineering-tool/p/p367244>`_
