Example 2: Creating a Buy and Sell App
======================================
This tutorial is a series of YouTube videos that explains the process of building a basic buy and sell app. This app allows the user to advertise their own products on the site, browse other products, search for other products, and purchase the products using PayPal. A PayPal account will be required for this tutorial. Each post has a title, description, formatted price, and as many photos as the seller wants.

The playlist of videos is available on the Student Design Hub YouTube channel through `this link. <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhKbMtzlokA&list=PLimB3dXD41B9WiDD3GwqMDVjukxiev1Tk>`_
