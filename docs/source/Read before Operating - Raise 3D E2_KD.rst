2. Launch the IdeaMaker slicer to slice your stl. IdeaMaker is optimized for use with the Raise3D and will help you optimize your printing results.

5. If using a computer that is not already connected through cloud you can use a usb stick and plug it in to the printer. 


6. To start your print simply hit the print button on the Raise 3D screen and navigate to your file. 


The majority of calibration, adjustments and, filament changing is done through the Raise 3D interface. Taking some time to familarize yourself with the screen is recommended.

It is important that you complete a bed leveling procedure before operating the printer. Failing to do so can result in the print head gouging the build plate, and ruining the nozzle. 

Always watch the first several layers of your print to ensure that it is adhering properly to the build plate.
