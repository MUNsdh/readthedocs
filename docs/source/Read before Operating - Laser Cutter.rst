5. When starting the print make sure the bed is calibrated using the tool as specified in :ref:`Trotec Launch`

6. Keep the lid shut at all times when laser is running. 

8. If the material (not the laser) catches on fire it means that you have too much power/current for how fast you are going. When this happens,
* Turn off the laser cutter
* Make a :ref:`New Material` preset and adjust power/current, speed, and PPI/Hz. For information on each parameter see: https://www.troteclaser.com/en-ca/learn-support/helpcenter/laser-parameters-definition

7. When finished cutting, wait a couple minutes to let the fan suck out the fumes under the lid
