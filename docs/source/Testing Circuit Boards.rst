Multimeters and Testing Circuit Boards
======================================

After full assembly, the circuit board needs to be confirmed as fully and appropriately functional through testing. Using a multimeter, the voltage output at each output (connectors, terminal blocks) should be confirmed as the expected outputs. A multimeter can be used to identify and confirm the parameters of a designed circuit.
