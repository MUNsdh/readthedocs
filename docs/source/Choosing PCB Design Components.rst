Choosing PCB Design Components
==============================
If you don’t understand it, read the datasheet.

PCB Components
--------------
Components are the electrical devices that form electrical circuits. Common components such as resistors, capacitors, 
and inductors are either through hole components (THT) or surface mount devices (SMD). All this refers to is how they 
are mounted on the circuit board. THT components require a hole in the board where the component’s leads are soldered as
seen below. While SMD components are placed directly on the surface of the boards seen below.
