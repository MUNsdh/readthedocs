Carbon Fibre Plate Manufacturing
================================
This tutorial describes the process of making a solid carbon fibre plate. The process involves 
fitting carbon fibre pieces to a core material and using resin/hardender to make the fibre rigid.
This same process can applied to other shapes as well.


Tools
-----
While preparing the plate it is best to wear gloves to prevent any resin or adhesive from touching your skin. 
Losing resin/adhesive at certain steps can mean that piece of the material will not cure. 


Easy Release Chemicals Agent (Volatile)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The easy release agent is used to prevent the material from sticking to the bed. Without this,
the material can be easily damaged when removed.

Core Material
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Material that lays between the carbon fibre plates.

Gum tape
^^^^^^^^
Used in the vacuum bagging process to seal the vacuum bag.


Peel Ply
^^^^^^^^

Meant to be peel away after vacuum bagging. Doesn't not stick to the material, just creates a layer.


Breather Cloth
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Soaks up excess resin coming from the permeable peel ply. This can be peeled off as it goes on the peel ply.

Epoxy
^^^^^
Epoxy resins are the most common type of resin used with carbon fibre. Epoxy resins adhere well to carbon fibre.
There is a resin side and a hardener. The resin is laid first and the hardener then cures the resin, stiffening it.


Hardener
^^^^^^^^
There are various hardeners that have different cure times. Some hardeners can take 24 hours or more while others
can cure in about 2 hours. The 24 hours takes much more time but the work is not as rushed as it would with a 
2 hour hardener.

Plate Making Preperation
------------------------
To begin the process the top and bottom layer must be cut out of the carbon fibre material. Cut whatever size that 
is needed for the core material.

Cut out a shape the same size as the one made from carbon fibre. The thickness of this material will be the 
thickness of the plate.

Place the core material in between the carbon fibre cuts.

Clean and prepare the bed using a rag or a line free paper towel
