Carbon Fibre Plate Manufacturing
================================
This tutorial describes the process of making a solid carbon fibre plate. The process involves 
fitting carbon fibre pieces to a core material and using resin/hardender to make the fibre rigid.
This same process can applied to other shapes as well.


Tools
-----
While preparing the plate it is best to wear gloves to prevent any resin or adhesive from touching your skin. 
Losing resin/adhesive at certain steps can mean that piece of the material will not cure. 


Easy Release Chemicals Agent (Volatile)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The easy release agent is used to prevent the material from sticking to the bed. Without this,
the material can be easily damaged when removed.

Core Material
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Material that lays between the carbon fibre plates.

Gum tape
^^^^^^^^
Used in the vacuum bagging process to seal the vacuum bag.

Peel Ply
^^^^^^^^

Meant to be peel away after vacuum bagging. Doesn't not stick to the material, just creates a layer.

Breather Cloth
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Soaks up excess resin coming from the permeable peel ply. We can peel this off as it goes on the peel ply.
