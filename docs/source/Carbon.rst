Carbon Fibre Plate Manufacturing
================================
This tutorial describes the process of making a solid carbon fibre plate. The process involves 
fitting carbon fibre pieces to a core material and using resin/hardender to make the fibre rigid.
This same process can applied to other shapes as well.


Tools
-----
While preparing the plate it is best to wear gloves to prevent any resin or adhesive from touching your skin. 
Losing resin/adhesive at certain steps can mean that piece of the material will not cure. 


Easy Release Chemicals Agent (Volatile)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The easy release agent is used to prevent the material from sticking to the bed. Without this,
the material can be easily damaged when removed.
