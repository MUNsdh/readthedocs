Read Before Operating - Bambu P1S Quick Start Guide
==================================================


Safety & Operations Notes: 

*  There is an emergency stop button on the X-Carve controller, this will cut power tot eh system immediately if there is an issue.

*  Always wear eye protection when operating the CNC. There is no cover so particles can fly up and enter your eyes.

*  Never run teh CNC without first connecting the shop-vacuum. This will minimize particles in the room that you may inhale or get in your eyes.

*  **NEVER** leave the machine **UNATTENDED** when in use. The computer must also be connected to the machine to function.

*  **DO NOT** handle any bits for this machine without **GLOVES.** The BITS are extremely SHARP.

*  It is critical to ensure your work piece is secure before you start any cutting operations. You can clamp or screw your work piece to the spoil board on the x-carve bed.
 
*  You may ruin your workpiece if the machine is not properly zeroed in the Z plane. You can use the z-probe to establish an accurate reference for your depth of cuts.
