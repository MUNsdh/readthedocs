Introduction
============
Bubble.io is a code-free online web tool that is used to make many kinds of web applications. It is very versatile and can be used for anything ranging from social media sites, online marketplaces, landing pages, etc. This tutorial will explain the basics of using the interface and also show how to make a few simple web apps.

The Basics
==========
The following subsections will describe how to get started with Bubble and some of its most basic features that you will inevitably use while making your apps.

Creating a New App
---------------
To start making apps with Bubble, you must first create an account. After that is done, navigating to the home screen will show a label that says "My apps" along with a blue button which says "New app":

After clicking the blue button, a popup will appear that will allow you to give your app a name, specify the type of app you want to build, etc. Please note that your app's name must be unique from all other app names create on Bubble (not just your own apps):

Press the blue button to be taken to the Bubble editor. You will see a popup on the left side of the screen called "New application assistant." By clicking "Let's get started," you will be able to change the icon and title that displays in your app's tab when it is running, along with a few other features that will be discussed later on.

The Design Tab
--------------

You should now see the Bubble editor's Design tab. This is where you will decide how your app will look to its users. You will be able to drag and drop elements into the white area on the right side of the screen. You will also be able to resize, rotate and reposition those elements to your liking. Right now there is probably a default webpage showing where this white space would normally be, but that can easily be cleared by drag-selecting everything and pressing the "delete" button on your keyboard.

The UI builder on the left allows you to add new elements to the page by dragging and dropping (or clicking and then dragging on the white space).You may notice several useful features under the "visual elements" dropdown:

Here is a brief explanation of each:

| **Text** - Allows you to add text to the screen. Its font type and size can be changed.
| **Button** - Allows you to add a button to the screen. Making the button do something requires starting a *workflow*, which will be discussed later.
| **Icon** - Adds a common icon of your choosing to the screen (a "like" button, for example).
| **Link** - Adds hyperlinked text to the screen.
| **Image** - Adds an image to the screen.
| **Shape** - Adds a rectangle to the screen.
| **Alert** - Shows a temporary message when an event occurs. Triggered using a workflow.
| **Video** - Adds a playable video to the screen. Video must be accessed through Youtube or Vimeo.
| **HTML** - Allows you to embed HTML code into your web app.
| **Map** - Allows you to add a map that can be navigated and referenced by other elements in your app.
| **Built on Bubble** - Adds an optional Bubble watermark to your app.

Within the UI builder there is also a dropdown called "Containers." It contains several features that are necessary for almost every kind of web app:

Here is what each container does:

| **Group** - Groups multiple elements together.
| **Repeating Group** - Repeats groups of elements vertically/horizontally on the page. Useful for displaying lists of data (comments on a post, for example).
| **Popup** - Shows a small "page" (really just a group) overlapping the original page when an event triggers it (a login popup, for example).
| **Floating Group** - A group of elements that stays in the same position on the screen as the user scrolls through the site.
| **Group Focus** - A group of elements that shows only when an event triggers it, and disappears once the user clicks outside of it.

The UI builder also has a dropdown titled "Input forms." These elements allow the user to enter information into the web app:

Here is what each input element does:

| **Input** - Allows the user to enter a single-line input.
| **Multiline Input** - Allows the user to enter a multiline input.
| **Checkbox** - Adds a checkbox to the interface.
| **Dropdown** - Allows the user to choose an input from multiple options (an example would be sorting posts in order of most popular, most recent, or least recent).
| **Search Box** -
