InventorCAM
===========

Introduction
------------
Inventor, like AUTOCAD is a computer aided design software application that supports 3D mechanical design, simulation, visualization, and documentation. 
This software enables users to construct accurate 3D models to aid in simulation and visualization before building products. 
Inventor operates on both Windows and Mac systems and comes in different file types like IAM, DW, IPN, IPTs.

This tutorial will discuss the computer-Aided Manufacturing steps using Inventor. For this tutorial, it is assumed that you have already created a part 
to be machined. With Inventor CAM you can generate and simulate toolpaths to create machine ready parts.

Set Up
------
One of the most important parts of InventorCAM is the Set up. When setting up make sure to take into consideration the part that you intend to 
machine and the things holding the parts down. Set up is a very important first step to consider when starting your manufacturing process. 
The selections available will help you define the working model stock size, fixtures and also set the World Coordinate System (WCS) zero.

Start by heading over to the CAM section and clicking the Set up option.
