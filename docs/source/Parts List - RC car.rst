Parts List
==========

 In order to build a remote-controlled (RC) car similar to the one in this tutorial you will need the following materials:

*  A microcontroller

   *  Ex: Arduino Uno

*  A motor driver with a H-bridge circuit

   *  Ex: L298N

*  A battery supply

   *  Ex: 7.4 V, 2 cell, 5200 mAh Goldbat LiPo battery. If using this battery you will also need a T-Type Deans connector male

*  A battery charger (if you choose a reusable battery like the one used in the tutorial)

*  Wires

   *  Male to Male, Male to Female.

*  A remote controller (transmitter and Receiver)

   *  Ex: Alican Dumborc X6 Transmitter (AA batteries required)  with the X6FG Receiver

*  Direct Current (DC) motors (x4)

   *  Ex: Swhmc 3-12V micro motors

*  Bearings (x2)

   *  Size depends on the design of wheels. If you decide to use the wheels provided in the STLâ€™s, the bearing needs an inner diameter of 8 mm and outer diameter of 22mm.

*  A 3D printer with filament

   *  Printers available in Student Design Hub for free. Filament needs to be purchased online, this tutorial uses ESun ABS filament for the base and rims, and Ninjatek TPU for the wheels. The Student Design Hub recommends ESun PLA+ for most applications.

*  Soldering Equipment

   *  Available in the Student Design Hub (SDH)

*  Mounting Device

   *  Used to attach all your components onto the RC car. I used velcro 3M strips.

This tutorial will serve as a general guide for any project requiring DC motor control. The principles used when making a RC car can be applied to many different functionalities and projects. In order to successfully design your own unique car, experience in CAD modeling is recommended, if not, do not worry. You can use the STL files below to copy the car made in this follow-along. Experience in C++ or C coding will also be helpful but is not required!
