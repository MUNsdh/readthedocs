So... you want to cut things using a

Luckily, this machine is fairly straightforward to use. By the end of this tutorial, you’ll be able to etch an image and cut a profile using the Troctec Speedy 300 Flexx.

The first step is to go to the equipment located in EN1017. Unfortunately, this equipment is only available for use during regular operational hours. All required software is already installed on the computer, so you’ll only need to bring the file you would like to cut and the material you’ll be using. In this tutorial, we’re going to be using a sheet of 1/8” White particleboard (or hardboard).

Before we start, we need to turn on the laser cutter. There’s a switch on the back left of the machine, as shown below:

**A Quick Note on Safety:Please reference the Laser Cutter Safety Page before cutting any material. There are materials that can generate dangerous chemicals and gases when processed by laser cutter.
