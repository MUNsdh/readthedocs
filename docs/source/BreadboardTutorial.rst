How to Use the Powered Breadboards in the Lab
=======================

Breadboards are used for testing out circuit designs without the need to solder the components together. This means that each component can be reused afterwards and does not need to be cut. The breadboards in the Student Design Hub come with a built-in power source, so powering the circuit with an external power source (such as batteries) is not always necessary. The powered breadboards do not need to be powered by their built-in power source in order to work.

How the Breadboards are Connected
---------------------------------
The following diagram shows how the breadboard is connected internally. Each yellow line can be thought of as a wire that connects to every hole it overlaps:

Each row on the breadboard is labelled numerically (1 to 64) and each column is labelled alphabetically (A to J). Putting two components in the same row (same number, different letters) connects them, but putting them in the same column (different numbers, same letter) does not.
