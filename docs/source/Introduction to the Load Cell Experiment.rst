Introduction to the Load Cell Experiment
========================================

Data analysis is an important experimentation step both in and outside of engineering applications and being able to analyze 
how a system is performing or reacting under certain conditions is crucial. One such device that allows users to record and 
analyze data is the DAQ, a Data Acquisition device. The DAQ available in the Student Hub is manufactured by National 
Instruments (NI) is capable of providing highly accurate data procured from a multitude of sensors. To learn how to properly 
operate such a device, this tutorial will provide instructions on how to set up the DAQ and measure data supplied by a force 
transducer, also known as a load cell.
