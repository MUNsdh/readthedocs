Troubleshooting 
===============


Residue in the Resin
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Small hardened pieces of cured resin as well as other debris can potentially fall into the tank below. 
Run the wiper gently through the resin tank, lifting it slightly off the bottom of the tank. If debris is found 
the tank must be emptied and refilled. The resin must be filtered when emptied to remove residue. There are coffee
filters in the cabinet below the Form 2 in the DDPL.

Overfilling the Build Platform
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
It is important to tilt larger models and not overfill the build platform with parts. An overfilled platform can 
make prints stick to the resin tank or even fall loose in the resin. The suction pressure is too great for the 
build platform to overcome, so the print fails. Printing less models at a rotated angle means less surface area 
per layer which will be easier to print.

Printer is Not Level
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The Form 2 must be levelled prior to printing, however it is possible the printer was moved during the printing process. 
The layer lines of the print will not be 90° and the print will fail. This will result in prints that are “loose” and 
do not adhere to the build plate correctly. Make sure the build plate and printer are level and the resin is at the right 
temperature for printing.

Unsupported Minima or Islands
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
When a section of a part is thin, lacking detail or missing completely it could be due to a lack of support material. 
To prevent this, always inspect the printing process using the slider on the right side of the Preform slicer window. 
Add supports to the failed section or reorientate the model to improve printability.

Hollowing
^^^^^^^^^
Be careful when hollowing the part as it is possible for a section to become too thin to print. A section is too 
thin if the walls are less than 2mm thick. In general, walls should be at least 3-5mm thick for best results. 
It is always important to add drainage holes on models that are hollowed to reduce the suction force.
