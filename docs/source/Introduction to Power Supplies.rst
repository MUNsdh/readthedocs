Introduction
============

Power Supplies are one of the most useful tools when testing and implementing electronics projects. They can be used to power your projects or test components such as LED and DC motors. Knowing how to use a power supply is essential for anyone designing electronics projects. This tutorial will explain how to use the DP712 and DP821 the Power supplies found the in the Student Design Hub. 
If you find it easier to learn by watching a video `here <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uraPWaeAgYA>`_ is a good basic tutorial on power supply . The power supply in this video is not the same as the power supplies in the student design hub but it is still a good resource to learn how to properly use power supplies.
